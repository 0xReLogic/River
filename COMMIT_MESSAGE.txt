feat(storage): complete Phase 2 - Storage Engine implementation

This commit completes the Phase 2 - Storage Engine implementation with the following features:

- LSM tree (levels 0-6) with level-triggered compaction
- WAL (write-ahead-log) with segment rotation for durability
- Checkpoint mechanism for fast recovery (target ≤ 3s)
- Manifest file (JSON) for LSM tree state tracking
- Optimized compaction with CPU usage metrics
- HTTP server with REST API for data operations
- CLI for server management (start, stop, restart)
- Benchmark suite for throughput and latency measurement
- Stress testing for crash recovery validation

Key improvements:
1. Enhanced recovery with checkpoint mechanism
2. Optimized compaction to prevent write stalls
3. Added CPU and throughput metrics for monitoring
4. Implemented level-triggered compaction strategy
5. Created CLI tools for server management
6. Added benchmark and stress testing tools

Next steps:
- Comprehensive testing to verify performance targets
- Profiling to identify and fix bottlenecks
- Optimization based on test results

SMART Goals for Phase 2:
- Durability: WAL with commit every 500ms, crash-recovery ≤ 3s
- Write Throughput: 1M rows/sec sustained on i3-1215U SSD
- Read Latency: Point-lookup ≤ 2ms, range scan 10k rows ≤ 10ms
- Compaction Overhead: Background merge L0→L1 ≤ 5% CPU, never stall writes
- Zero-downtime ops: Add/remove node, restart process with no missed writes
